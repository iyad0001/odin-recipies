      <ul>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Bread Flour</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C),
          and lightly grease a pizza pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand
          until creamy, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You
          can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to
          make it easier.
        </li>
        <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a
          12-inch circle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer to the prepared pizza pan and spread crust with sauce and
          toppings of your choice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
          Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
