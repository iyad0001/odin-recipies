# HTML Project1: The Odin Project

This is my first HTML project in the odin project curriculum. Throughout this project I learned:

1. Don't forget to commit often. Set reminder if necessary.
2. Prefer StackOverFlow and other web sources over AI tools like ChatGPT.
3. Use unsplash for stock photos.
4. Prefer SSH rather than HTTPS, unless if having problems with ssh use https.
